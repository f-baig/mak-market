# Market MKR

This game is meant to emulate market making conditions in interviews at top quant firms. You will be prompted to select an intial bid-ask range, after which trades will be levied against you. You will be allowed to modify and shift your range as you deem fit, and at the end of the rounds your total PnL will be calculated. 

For now it just handles markets based on cards in a deck, however future iterations may be developed with more interesting scenarios.

(Sort of buggy right now + need to implement different shift amounts)
